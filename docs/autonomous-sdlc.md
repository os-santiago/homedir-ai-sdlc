# Autonomous SDLC Operating Model

This document defines the issue-driven autonomous SDLC for HomeDir.

## Principle

Automation is autonomous only inside repository rules. It must never bypass, weaken,
or overwrite branch protection, repository rulesets, required checks, required
reviews, secret handling, or deployment gates.

If a rule blocks progress, the automation reports the blocker and moves the issue
to a human-needed state.

The autonomous SDLC must be managed by the SSH server, not by a developer
workstation. Local machines may bootstrap or update the server, but the normal
listener, worker, credentials, logs, queue, GitHub authentication, SCC runtime,
and repository worktree all live on the server.

## Trigger

An issue is eligible only when all conditions are true:

- The issue is open.
- The issue can be authored by anyone.
- An authorized labeler added the `ready-to-implement` admission label.
- The issue has been promoted to the `scc-queued` execution queue.
- The issue does not have an active terminal or in-progress automation label.
- The issue metadata is clear enough to implement and validate.

OpenClaw may act as the event listener. The worker may also poll GitHub as a
fallback. Both paths must apply the same eligibility rules.

For event-driven operation, configure OpenClaw to pass GitHub issue event
payloads to:

```bash
/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/bin/homedir-sdlc-openclaw-listener.sh <payload.json>
```

The listener only wakes the worker when the event belongs to this repository,
the issue is open, the label added was `ready-to-implement`, and the actor who
added the label is listed in `HOMEDIR_SDLC_AUTHORIZED_LABELERS`. Accepted issues
are promoted to `scc-queued`; unauthorized attempts are moved to the discard
queue with `scc-rejected` and `scc-rejected:unauthorized-labeler`. The worker
remains the only component that claims, branches, runs SCC, opens PRs, and
reconciles releases. Keep `homedir-sdlc-worker.timer` enabled as a fallback and
reconciliation loop.

## Lifecycle Labels

Use these labels for automation state:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ready-to-implement` | Human request for authorized AI SDLC admission |
| `scc-queued` | Authorized issue admitted to the AI SDLC execution queue |
| `scc-running` | The SCC worker has claimed the issue |
| `scc-pr-open` | A pull request was opened for the issue |
| `scc-waiting-checks` | The PR is waiting for CI, CodeRabbit, or branch-protection feedback |
| `scc-failing-checks` | One or more PR checks failed and the worker will attempt SCC remediation |
| `scc-under-review` | The PR has actionable review feedback or is in an automated remediation cycle |
| `scc-coverage-gap` | The PR lacks evidence that it covers the issue request or acceptance criteria |
| `scc-approved` | Checks passed, no actionable automated review feedback remains, and issue coverage evidence is present |
| `scc-merged` | The PR was merged and the `Production Release` workflow succeeded |
| `scc-failed` | Automation failed after allowed retries |
| `needs-human` | A repository rule, unclear requirement, security concern, or repeated failure requires human action |
| `scc-rejected` | Issue was rejected from the AI SDLC queue |
| `scc-rejected:unauthorized-labeler` | `ready-to-implement` was added by an unauthorized actor |

Existing `wos-review` triage can remain separate. It should not trigger
implementation unless `ready-to-implement` is admitted into `scc-queued`.

## Worker Flow

1. Acquire a lock so only one worker instance mutates the repository at a time.
2. Fetch eligible issues from GitHub.
3. Claim one issue by adding `scc-running`.
4. Create or reset a clean local worktree from `origin/main`.
5. Create branch `scc/issue-<number>-<slug>`.
6. Run `scc -yq` with the controlled implementation prompt.
7. Require a PR branch and pull request, never a direct push to `main`.
8. Run local validation appropriate to the change.
9. Push the branch and create/update a PR with `Refs #<issue>`. Do not use a
   closing keyword in the PR body.
10. Mark the issue `scc-waiting-checks` while CI and review feedback run.
11. Every worker cycle, reconcile PR state:
    - failed checks move the issue to `scc-failing-checks` and `scc-under-review`;
    - actionable review feedback moves the issue to `scc-under-review`;
    - missing technical coverage evidence moves the issue to `scc-coverage-gap`
      and `scc-under-review`;
    - SCC is re-run on the existing PR branch with the failing checks and review
      context;
    - successful remediation commits are pushed back to the same PR branch.
12. Repeat remediation until checks and actionable review feedback are clear, or
    until `HOMEDIR_SDLC_MAX_REMEDIATION_ATTEMPTS` is reached.
13. Mark the issue `scc-approved` and enable normal auto-merge only when
    checks, review feedback, issue coverage evidence, and repository protection
    allow it.
14. Monitor release workflows after merge.
15. Comment on the issue with the resolving PR, merge commit, merge timestamp,
    release workflow URL, validation summary, and final SDLC state.
16. Remove transient lifecycle labels, add `scc-merged`, then explicitly close
    the issue.

## Server Ownership

The VPS is the system of record for autonomous execution:

- Runtime user: `homedir-sdlc`
- Runtime repo checkout: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/share/homedir-sdlc/worktrees/homedir`
- Worker state: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc`
- Successful run summaries: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/run-summaries`
- Worker logs: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/logs/worker.log`
- SCC install: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/share/sc-agent-cli`
- SCC wrapper: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/bin/scc`
- Worker service: `homedir-sdlc-worker.service`
- Worker schedule: `homedir-sdlc-worker.timer`

The server must be able to recover after reboot without this workstation:

- systemd starts the timer.
- `gh` auth and SCC provider credentials are configured on the server under the `homedir-sdlc` account.
- The worker fetches from GitHub directly.
- Branches and PRs are pushed from the server.
- GitHub Actions owns release and deployment after merge.
- The worker reconciles merged SDLC PRs from its issue state files and only
  applies `scc-merged` and closes the issue after the matching
  `Production Release` run for the merge commit succeeds.

The worker must exit without processing issues when server-side GitHub
authentication is missing. It must not rely on a workstation `gh` session,
browser login, mounted Windows credential store, or local environment variable.

Use `platform/scripts/homedir-sdlc-bootstrap.sh` on the server for first install
or repair. It installs Ansible locally, pulls this repository, and applies the
local runner playbook against `localhost`.

When the SSH account does not have passwordless root/sudo access, use
`platform/scripts/homedir-sdlc-user-bootstrap.sh` instead. That mode installs
the runner under the SSH user's home directory:

- Platform checkout: `$HOME/.local/share/homedir-platform`
- SCC checkout: `$HOME/.local/share/sc-agent-cli`
- Node runtime: `$HOME/.local/opt/node-*`
- Worker wrapper: `$HOME/.local/bin/homedir-sdlc-worker.sh`
- Worker env: `$HOME/.config/homedir-sdlc/env`
- User units: `$HOME/.config/systemd/user/homedir-sdlc-worker.*`
- Logs and state: `$HOME/.local/state/homedir-sdlc`

This still satisfies server ownership because the normal worker runtime,
credentials, logs, queue, and repository worktree remain on the SSH server.

For production operation, prefer a dedicated non-root account named
`homedir-sdlc`. Root may bootstrap, repair, or rotate credentials, but the
worker service and timer should run as `homedir-sdlc`, not as root.

## Non-Bypass Rules

The worker and SCC prompt must forbid:

- `git push origin main`
- `git push --force` against protected branches
- `gh pr merge --admin`
- GitHub API changes to branch protection
- GitHub API changes to repository rulesets
- Disabling or removing required status checks
- Printing, echoing, or embedding tokens in logs
- Editing secrets or secret files unless a human explicitly requested a rotation

Allowed operations:

- Create implementation branches.
- Commit and push branch changes.
- Create or update pull requests.
- Add status comments and automation labels.
- Request or enable normal auto-merge only after the worker marks the PR
  `scc-approved` and branch protection permits it.

## Approval and Merge

If `main` requires one approval, automation must satisfy that rule with normal
GitHub mechanisms. SCC must not approve its own PR and must not use administrator
bypass. Valid options are:

- A separate GitHub App or bot identity reviews only policy-compliant PRs.
- A human reviewer approves.
- Repository rules explicitly define an approved automation path.

Until one of those options exists, autonomous implementation can open PRs, but
full autonomous merge is intentionally blocked by governance.

## Failure Handling

Move to `needs-human` when:

- Requirements are ambiguous.
- Local validation repeatedly fails.
- CI fails after the configured retry limit.
- Required review is missing and no compliant automation identity is available.
- Branch protection or rulesets block merge.
- Production release verification fails after merge.
- The issue requests security-policy changes, secret access, or bypass behavior.

Move to `scc-failed` only for execution failures that do not need clarification,
such as missing tools, provider errors, or repository checkout failures.

The worker also reconciles legacy closed issues that still carry automation
lifecycle labels. If a human or another compliant flow closes an issue, the
worker removes temporary automation labels instead of leaving stale
`needs-human`, `scc-running`, `scc-queued`, or `ready-to-implement` state
behind.

## Observability

The runner writes:

- Worker log: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/logs/worker.log`
- OpenClaw listener log: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/logs/openclaw-listener.log`
- Heartbeat JSON: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/heartbeat.json`
- Issue state files: `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/issues/`

Use the status probe for monitors and manual diagnosis:

```bash
sudo -iu homedir-sdlc /home/homedir-sdlc/.local/bin/homedir-sdlc-status.sh
```

The probe exits non-zero when the heartbeat is stale or the user timer is not
active. Set `HOMEDIR_SDLC_HEARTBEAT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` to tune the threshold.

Optional alerting uses a Discord-compatible webhook:

```bash
HOMEDIR_SDLC_ALERTS_ENABLED=true
HOMEDIR_SDLC_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL_FILE=/home/homedir-sdlc/.config/homedir-sdlc/alert-webhook-url
```

Alerts are best-effort and must not block the SDLC. Alert on SCC execution
failure, blocked auto-merge, production release failure, stale heartbeat, and
issues moved to `needs-human`.

## Operations Runbook

Check service health:

```bash
wsl ssh -i /home/scanales/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@72.60.141.165 \
  'sudo -iu homedir-sdlc systemctl --user status homedir-sdlc-worker.timer homedir-sdlc-worker.service'
```

Check worker status:

```bash
wsl ssh -i /home/scanales/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@72.60.141.165 \
  'sudo -iu homedir-sdlc /home/homedir-sdlc/.local/bin/homedir-sdlc-status.sh'
```

Tail SDLC logs:

```bash
wsl ssh -i /home/scanales/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@72.60.141.165 \
  'sudo -iu homedir-sdlc tail -200 /home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/logs/worker.log'
```

Trigger a manual reconciliation cycle:

```bash
wsl ssh -i /home/scanales/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@72.60.141.165 \
  'sudo -iu homedir-sdlc systemctl --user start homedir-sdlc-worker.service'
```

Validate the production runtime after an autonomous merge:

```bash
wsl ssh -i /home/scanales/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@72.60.141.165 \
  'curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/q/health && podman ps --filter name=homedir'
```

Post-merge cleanup verification:

After an AI SDLC tracked PR is merged, the worker will remove transient labels (such as `ai-sdlc-track`, `scc-waiting-checks`, `scc-under-review`, and `scc-failing-checks`) and apply the expected terminal `scc-merged` label.
This repeated reconciliation process is idempotent. Operators can verify the final state and labels of a merged PR by running:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json state,labels
```

Canary test:

The SCC v0.4.0 canary validates that the autonomous worker:
- Keeps scope strictly on the assigned issue (issue focus).
- Correctly handles the current working directory for tool execution.

1. Create or choose a small issue authored by any contributor.
2. Have an authorized labeler, such as `scanalesespinoza`, add `ready-to-implement`.
3. Confirm the webhook or polling fallback promotes the issue to `scc-queued`.
4. Confirm the worker claims it, opens a branch and PR, respects checks, and
   waits for normal repository rules.
5. After merge, confirm `Production Release` succeeds and the worker marks the
   issue `scc-merged`.

Recovery:

1. Confirm GitHub CLI auth under `homedir-sdlc`: `gh auth status`.
2. Confirm SCC runs under `homedir-sdlc`: `scc --help`.
3. Restart the timer: `systemctl --user restart homedir-sdlc-worker.timer`.
4. If the worktree is corrupt, stop the timer, remove only the worker worktree
   under `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/share/homedir-sdlc/worktrees/homedir`, then
   start the timer. The next cycle reclones from GitHub.
5. If an issue is incorrectly stuck, remove only lifecycle labels after reading
   the issue comments and worker log.

Credential rotation:

1. Revoke the old shared token.
2. Prefer a GitHub App installation token or a fine-grained token scoped only to
   the HomeDir repository permissions required by `gh issue`, `gh pr`, and
   branch pushes.
3. Install the replacement secret on the server under the `homedir-sdlc`
   account using `gh auth login` or a mode-0600 environment/credential file.
4. Run `gh auth status`, start a worker cycle, and verify no token values appear
   in logs.

## Audit Trail

Every cycle must leave:

- Issue comment with branch, PR, validation, and final state.
- Branch name tied to issue number.
- PR body with `Refs #<issue>`. The worker closes the issue only after merge
  and release verification succeed.
- Conventional commit or squash title.
- Worker logs under `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc/logs/worker.log`.
- State under `/home/homedir-sdlc/.local/state/homedir-sdlc`.

## Deployment Boundary

The autonomous SDLC does not deploy directly. It merges through the normal PR
path. The existing `Production Release` GitHub Actions workflow owns build,
image publishing, SSH deployment, fallback timer reconciliation, and production
health verification.
